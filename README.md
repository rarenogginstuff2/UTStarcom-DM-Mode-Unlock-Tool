# UTStarcom-DM-Mode-Unlock-Tool
This tool can be used to unlock DM mode on a UTStarcom CDM-7025, so that the phone can then be used with any Qualcomm DM tool (e.g. Revskills, BitPim, QPST, etc.).

How to use: Simply open the script with a text editor, change the COM port to match your phone, close the text editor, and run the script. Use utdmunlock.py for most models (Generic, US Cellular), use utdmunlock_sprint.py for Sprint models, use utdmunlock_metro.py for MetroPCS models, use utdmunlock_verizon.py for Verizon models. Also, if you write to the phone with QPST Service Programming after unlocking the DM mode (e.g. to change the SPC), the DM unlock becomes permanent. Normally, if you just run the tool and reboot the phone, DM mode will relock until you run the tool again. But if you run the tool and then write to the phone with QPST Service Programming, it will permanently stay unlocked, even if you reboot the phone.
