# UTStarcom-DM-Mode-Unlock-Tool
This tool can be used to unlock DM mode on a UTStarcom CDM-7025, so that the phone can then be used with any Qualcomm DM tool (e.g. Revskills, BitPim, QPST, etc.).

How to use: Simply open the script with a text editor, change the COM port to match your phone, close the text editor, and run the script. Use utdmunlock.py for most models, use utdmunlock_sprint.py for Sprint models.
